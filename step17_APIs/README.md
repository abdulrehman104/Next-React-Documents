# APIs (Application Programming Interface):

API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are commonly used to enable integration between different systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly. They provide a way for developers to access the functionality or data of another application without needing to understand how that functionality is implemented internally.
