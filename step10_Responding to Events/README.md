# Event Handlers

In React, you can attach event handlers to JSX elements. Event handlers are custom functions defined by the developer, which are triggered in response to various user interactions such as clicking, hovering, focusing on form inputs, and other similar actions. These event handlers allow developers to define specific behavior or actions that should occur when certain events occur within the application's user interface. By adding event handlers to JSX elements, developers can create interactive and dynamic user experiences in React applications.
