# Components

## What is Components?

Components are the building blocks of React.js applications. They are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface. In simpler terms, components are like custom HTML elements that you can use to create the structure and behavior of your web application.

## Why we use it?

1. **Reusability**: Components allow us to encapsulate specific UI elements or functionalities into reusable modules. This means we can write code once and use it multiple times throughout our application, reducing redundancy and making our code more maintainable.

2. **Modularity**: Components promote a modular architecture, where each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI. This makes it easier to understand, develop, and maintain large-scale applications, as we can break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces.

3. **Composition**: Components can be composed together to create more complex UIs. We can nest components within other components, building upon their functionalities to create sophisticated user interfaces.
