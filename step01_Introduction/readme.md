## What is Library and Framework:

### Library:

Imagine you're writing a novel, and you need to reference different sources and materials to enhance your writing. A library would be like having access to a vast collection of books, articles, and resources to help you with your writing process.

Similarly, in web development, a library provides you with a collection of pre-written code snippets, functions, and utilities that you can use to simplify common tasks or add specific functionalities to your project.

### Framework:

Imagine you're tasked with building a house from scratch, but you're new to construction and don't know where to start. A construction framework would be like having a detailed blueprint, a set of specialized tools, and a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

Similarly, in web development, a framework provides you with a structured approach, pre-built tools, and established best practices to create websites or web applications.

## React.Js:

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. We use React because it simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows developers to build reusable components, manage state efficiently, and update the user interface quickly and seamlessly. With React, we can create complex web applications with smooth and responsive user experience, making development faster and more efficient.


## Next.js:

In web development, Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React.js that simplifies the process of building server-rendered React applications. Here's why developers use Next.js:

Next.js is a tool that helps beginners to build websites using React.js more easily. It handles things like making your website load fast and show up well on search engines. It also helps with creating different pages for your website and connecting them together smoothly. Overall, it makes building websites with React.js simpler for beginners.
