# INTRODCUTION TO WEB DEVELOPMENT:

Web development refers to the process of building websites or web applications that are accessible over the internet. It's an essential field because it enables individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments to create an online presence and interact with users worldwide.

### 1- Front-End Development:

They focus on what users see and interact with on a website. They use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity

### 2- Back-End Development:

They handle the server-side of the website, which users don't directly see. They work on processing user requests, managing databases, and generating dynamic content.

## What is Library and Framework:

### Library:

Imagine you're writing a novel, and you need to reference different sources and materials to enhance your writing. A library would be like having access to a vast collection of books, articles, and resources to help you with your writing process.

Similarly, in web development, a library provides you with a collection of pre-written code snippets, functions, and utilities that you can use to simplify common tasks or add specific functionalities to your project.

### Framework:

Imagine you're tasked with building a house from scratch, but you're new to construction and don't know where to start. A construction framework would be like having a detailed blueprint, a set of specialized tools, and a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

Similarly, in web development, a framework provides you with a structured approach, pre-built tools, and established best practices to create websites or web applications.

## Difference b/w Library & Framework:

### Library:

• A library is like having a collection of specialized tools and resources that you can use for specific tasks during the construction process.

• It offers pre-written code snippets, functions, and utilities to simplify common tasks or add specific functionalities.

### Framework:

• A framework is like having a comprehensive blueprint and a complete set of construction tools for building a house.
• It provides a structured approach and predefined conventions for organizing your project and implementing functionalities.

### So we can use React as a library and next.js as a Framework.

## React.Js:

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces for web applications. We use React because it simplifies the process of creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows developers to build reusable components, manage state efficiently, and update the user interface quickly and seamlessly. With React, we can create complex web applications with smooth and responsive user experience, making development faster and more efficient.

### Benefits of React.js:

## Next.js:

In web development, Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React.js that simplifies the process of building server-rendered React applications. Here's why developers use Next.js:

Next.js is a tool that helps beginners to build websites using React.js more easily. It handles things like making your website load fast and show up well on search engines. It also helps with creating different pages for your website and connecting them together smoothly. Overall, it makes building websites with React.js simpler for beginners.

### Benefits of Next.js:

Next.js offers several benefits for web developers, including:

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js supports server-side rendering, which improves performance by generating HTML for each page on the server.
2. Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js provides static site generation, allowing you to pre-render your website as static HTML files at build time.
3. Built-in Routing: Next.js comes with a built-in routing system that simplifies the process of creating multi-page applications.

Overall, Next.js offers a powerful combination of performance, flexibility, and developer productivity, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications and websites

## Installation:

To install Next.js, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer.
Once you have Node.js, you can follow these steps to install Next.js:
Next.js:
Run the following command to install Next.js as a dependency in your project:

```tsx
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/_)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/_
```

## Folder Structure & First Program: 
We'll explain this when we create the folder.
